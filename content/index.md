      I'm a software engineer, currently working at [AppsFlyer](http://appsflyer.com/) in their Platform group. Previously, I was a software engineer in [VMware's Tanzu division](https://cloud.vmware.com/tanzu), building [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/). I'm interested in Go, Machine Learning, and Agile methodologies, and I enjoy the use of an [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/).
